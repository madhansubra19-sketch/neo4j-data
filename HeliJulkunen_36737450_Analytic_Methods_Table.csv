Examples of overall biomarker signatures compared for incidence of b Other diseases of liver (K76) and Other polyneuropathies (G62), and c Acute myocardial infarction (I21) and Heart failure (I50). The hazard ratios for each biomarker are shown as points with 95% confidence intervals (CI) indicated in vertical and horizontal error bars. The colouring of the points indicates the significance of the biomarker association for the pair of diseases. The red lines denote a hazard ratio of 1, and the grey line denotes the diagonal.

Analyses in the UK biobank were additionally adjusted for the UK biobank assessment centre. Filled points indicate statistically significant associations (p < 5e-5), and hollow points non-significant ones. Black horizontal line denotes a hazard ratio of 1. Event numbers for incident disease or mortality in the two biobanks are shown in Table 2. ICD-10 codes used for compiling the composite endpoints are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The replication results are shown here for six endpoints available in THL biobank; results for all overlapping endpoints are shown in Supplementary Fig. 16. Results are shown separately for each of the five Finnish cohorts in Supplementary Fig. 17.
