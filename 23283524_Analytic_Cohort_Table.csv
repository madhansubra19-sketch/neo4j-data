23283524,23283524.1,Nurses Health Study,case control,,,,,,,Homo Sapiens,"From 1989–1990, an initial blood sample was collected from 32,826 cohort members (women), who were 43–69 years of age

A second blood sample was collected from a subset of these women in 2000–2002;  women who were still alive, had responded to a recent questionnaire and had no history of cancer, were invited to participate. 

The breast cancer cases and controls in this analysis are women who, at either blood collection, were postmenopausal and had not used postmenopausal hormones for at least 3 months. Cases who did not provide a second blood sample or were diagnosed prior to the 2nd collection contributed one blood sample to the analysis; cases diagnosed after donating a second blood sample provided one or two samples to the analysis, depending on their menopausal and hormone use status at each draw.

All breast cancer cases were confirmed by medical records or verbally by the nurse [24]. We matched two control subjects (except for DHEAS, 1:1 match for 2002–2008 cycles for financial reasons) per case by age (±1 year), month (±1 month) and time of day (±2 h) of blood collection, and fasting status (≥10 h since a meal vs. <10 h or unknown) at each blood collection.",51569,Hormones,,
