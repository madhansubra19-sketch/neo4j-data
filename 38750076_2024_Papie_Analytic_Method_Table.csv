38750076,"38750076.1.2","Protein levels in blood samples","Cox Regression","Multivariable-adjusted models were additionally adjusted for cancer-specific risk factors (see Extended “Methods”). Cancer-specific risk factors were chosen upon review of the literature and restricted to variables available in the UK Biobank. We used an effective number of tests (ENT) correction for multiple testing, applied in a family-wise manner by cancer type. The ENT method accounts for multiple tests by applying a Bonferroni correction that determines the number of independent tests as the number of principal components needed to explain 95% of the variance in protein abundance. In this case, this was 639 independent tests27.",NA
