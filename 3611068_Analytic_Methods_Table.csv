36111068,36111068.1.1,odds ratio,Logistic Regression,"We observed a positive association between pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS concentrations and risk of HCC (Table 3). The strongest association was between PFOS and HCC. Plasma PFOS concentrations >54.9 μg/L were associated with 4.5 times higher odds of HCC (95% CI 1.20–16.00; p = 0.02). This threshold corresponded to the 90th percentile of exposure in NHANES 1999-2000.43 PFUnDA levels greater than 1.22 μg/L were associated with 2.2 times higher odds of HCC, although this association did not reach statistical significance (95% CI 0.92–5.50; p = 0.07). Effect estimates were calculated using conditional logistic regression to account for the matched case-control study design.",
