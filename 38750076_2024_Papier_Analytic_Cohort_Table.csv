38750076,38750076.1,"UK Biobank analysis cohort","Here, we use an integrated multi-omics approach combining prospective cohort and exome-variant study designs to identify proteins with a role in cancer aetiology: we describe the association of 1463 protein biomarkers quantified using the Olink platform with the risk of 19 common cancers and 9 cancer subsites in 44,645 UK Biobank participants, overall and by time to diagnosis. We further assess the identified protein-cancer associations as aetiological risk factors using exome cis-pQTL variant and exome-wide genetic score analyses (exGS).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"This study is based on data from the UK Biobank participants, a prospective cohort of 503,317 adults aged between 39 and 73, recruited between 2006 and 2010 from across the UK. The study design and rationale have been described elsewhere34,41. Briefly, eligible participants were those registered with the National Health Service in England, Scotland or Wales who lived within travelling distance of one of the 22 assessment centres in these regions. In total, ~5% of invited participants joined the study by attending a baseline visit, where they completed a touchscreen questionnaire, had anthropometric data and biological samples taken by trained staff, and gave informed written consent to be followed up through national record linkage.","Homo Sapiens","Olink proteomics was measured in EDTA plasma on 54,221 UK Biobank participants. Two participants were removed due to withdrawn consent from the UK Biobank and 1429 samples were removed as part of quality control procedures. These procedures included identifying and excluding participants with a median protein value or median interquartile range across all protein values that lay more than five standard deviations outside the scaled mean median protein value or mean median interquartile range across all protein values in the cohort. More details can be found in a previous publication by the UKB-PPP46. We further excluded 2969 participants due to cancer diagnosis at or before baseline (except non-melanoma skin cancer C44), 37 whose self-reported sex did not match their genetic sex, 242 who had missing information on height or weight, 2113 who were currently using hormone replacement therapy or oral contraceptives, and 2709 who reported having diabetes at baseline. Following these exclusions, the maximal analysis cohort included 44,645 participants (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for participant flowchart).",44645,"Proteomics",NA,NA
