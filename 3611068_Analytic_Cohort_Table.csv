36111068,36111068.1,Multiethnic Cohort Study,,,,,,,,Homo Sapiens,"This study included 50 incident non-viral HCC cases and 50 controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases and controls were matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and study area. MEC is a unique, ethnically diverse prospective cohort of >200,000 African Americans, Latinos, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, and Whites followed since the early 1990s in California and Hawaii. Incident cancers including HCC over >20-years of follow-up were identified by the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Comprehensive epidemiologic risk factor data from questionnaires, health condition data from Medicare claims, and California hospital discharge and mortality information from national mortality databases were also collected. The underlying etiology of HCC was identified using a combination of viral hepatitis testing and Medicare claims and classified into viral (hepatitis B or hepatitis C related), NAFLD, alcohol related, and others as previously described.[37], [38], [39] The breakdown of etiology in HCC cases was 33 (66%) NAFLD, 4 (8%) alcohol related, and 13 (26%) cryptogenic cirrhosis. HCC cases with known viral etiology were excluded from this study. Controls were free from diagnosed liver disease, including metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease. This study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, and ethics approval for this study was provided by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Southern California (HS-17-00714) and the University of Hawaii (CHS 9575).",100,Metabolites,,
