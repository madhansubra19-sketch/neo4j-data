We investigated whether indices of obesity and circulating adipokine levels could predict incident cancer risk.",,

,,,,,,"Materials and methods: This longitudinal community-based study included subjects from the Hong Kong Cardiovascular Risk Factors Prevalence Study (CRISPS) study commenced in 1995-1996 (CRISP-1) with baseline assessments including indices of obesity. Subjects were reassessed in 2000-2004 (CRISPS-2) with measurement of serum levels of adipokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2; as a surrogate marker of tumor necrosis factor-à activity), leptin, lipocalin 2, adiponectin and adipocyte-fatty acid binding protein (A-FABP). Incident cancer cases were identified up to 31 December 2011.",,

,,,,,,"Results: 205 of 2893 subjects recruited at CRISPS-1 had developed incident cancers. More of the subjects who developed cancers were obese (22.1 vs 16.1%) or had central obesity (36.6 vs 24.5%) according to Asian cut-offs. Waist circumference (adjusted HR 1.02 [1.00-1.03] per cm; p=0.013), but not body mass index (adjusted HR 1.04 [1.00-1.08] per kg/mý; p=0.063), was a significant independent predictor for incident cancers after adjustment for age, sex and smoking status. 99 of 1899 subjects reassessed at CRISPS-2 had developed cancers. Subjects who developed cancers had significantly higher level of hsCRP, IL-6, sTNFR2 and lipocalin 2. After adjustment for conventional risk factors, only IL-6 (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.18-1.95) and sTNFR2 (HR 3.27, 95%CI 1.65-6.47) predicted cancer development.",,
